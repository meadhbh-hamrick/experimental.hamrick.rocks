Experiments with GitHub and AWS

This is a small project I'm using to test out a few features in
WebStorm, GitHub and AWS. The idea is I want to have a simple
web site hosted on GitHub (also where the repo exists) which uses
AWS lambdas to provide a (very) simple API.

Replacing a test line with a second test line.
